# Aim
The primary aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to accurately predict the price of properties, specifically for Airbnb listings. By utilizing a range of property features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, cleaning fees, and derived metrics, this model helps property owners estimate appropriate listing prices and provides insights into market trends.

# Problem Statement
Pricing a property on platforms like Airbnb involves several challenges, including:

- **Uncertainty in Market Trends:** Property owners often struggle to set competitive prices without deep market knowledge.
  
- **Complex Dependencies:** Property price depends on multiple factors, including location, amenities, and property size, making manual predictions unreliable.
  
- **Risk of Revenue Loss:** Incorrect pricing can result in either loss of potential bookings or underutilization of profit margins.
  
This project addresses these challenges by creating a predictive solution that ensures fair pricing while helping property owners optimize their revenue.
